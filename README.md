1. Basic use-cass up and running
2. Hardcoded the dummy responses for now in the code
3. Animations are not matching with the oriinals, customised and kept them simple

Things missing from original design

1. API integration
2. Mobile responsiveness is not 100% - the left menu doesn't appear for smaller widths
3. The profile bar on the right side of the header
4. The geo location on the bottom left of menu
5. The chat window only supports one query at a time, if we type a new query the previous response is washed away
6. Editing a query in the response window is not supported
7. Unit testing

1. Basic unit tests added

1. Fine tuning pixels with original design
2. Mobile responsiveness handled (not 100% but most of the tasks are now manageable)
3. Editing a query in response window - when the query returns no response (click "No response" tile on the homepage)
4. Profile and settings button in header - they are unclickable
5. Unit tests for all these mentioned cases
