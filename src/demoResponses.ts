## GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)

For GFM, you can *also* use a plugin:
[remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#use).
It adds support for GitHub-specific extensions to the language:
tables, strikethrough, tasklists, and literal URLs.

These features **do not work by default**.
ðŸ‘† Use the toggle above to add the plugin.

| Feature    | Support              |

| CommonMark | 100%                 |
| GFM        | 100% w/ remark-gfm |
